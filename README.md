# Clickbait Analysis

The main files of the folder are:

- A notebook were the Clickbait classifier is trained (`clickbait_clf_v2.ipynb`)
- A notebook that contains the time analysis on the NYT headlines (`NYT_analysis.ipynb`)
- A notebook about the UK journals analysis (`UK_news_analysis.ipynb`)
- A folder with the scripts I used to web-scrape the UK newspapers (`webpage_scraping`)

#### Important
To run the `NYT_analysis.ipynb` and `UK_news_analysis.ipynb` notebook you first have to train and store the classifier in a `.joblib` file. 
To do so just run the `clickbait_clf_v2.ipynb` notebook.
