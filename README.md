# Clickbait Analysis

Due to large dimensions I cuold not upload the trained version of the clickbait classifier. 
So if you want to run the notebook `NYT_analysis` you first have to train and store the classifier in a `.joblib` file. 
To do so it sufficies to run the cells in `clickbait_clf_v2.ipynb`.
